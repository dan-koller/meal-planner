# Meal Planner

This is a simple meal planner that I wrote to help me plan my meals for the week. It's a command line tool that
allows you to add meals to a database and then plan them for the week.

## Get started

### Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Java 17
- Gradle 7.2
- PostgreSQL 14


1. Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dan-koller/meal-planner
```

2. Set up the database (Check out the [database setup](#database-setup) section for more details)
   _For example_, if you're using Homebrew on Apple Silicon, you can use the following command:

```shell
pg_ctl -D /opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@14 start
```

2. Build the project

```shell
./gradlew build
```

3. Run the project

```shell
./gradlew run
```

_You can also run the project from your IDE of choice._

## Usage

You can add new meals, show meals for a category, plan meals for the week, and create a shopping list.

### Add a new meal

```shell
What would you like to do (add, show, plan, save, exit)?

   macOS [here](https://gist.github.com/dan-koller/ba756dec5f9beeba02cc12fe2acf7211))
